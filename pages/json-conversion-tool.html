<h2 id="json-conversion-tool">JSON Conversion Tool</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>To assist agencies with preparation of their required DCOI Strategic Plans, a conversion tool for transferring text into a compatible, machine-readable JSON file is provided below. Agencies' final DCOI Strategic Plans then must be published at <code>‘agency’.gov/digitalstrategy/datacenteroptimizationstrategicplan.json</code> according to the following deadlines:
</p>

<table>
    <tr>
        <th>Fiscal Year</th><th>due on or before</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2016</td><td>September 30, 2016</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2017</td><td>April 14, 2017</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2018</td><td>April 13, 2018</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2019</td><td>February 15, 2019</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>2020</td><td>February 14, 2020</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<h3>Guidance</h3>
<p>Please enter the relevant data into each fields below. Data can be entered manually or automatically uploaded by clicking the ‘Load my own data’ button on the screen.</p>

<p>Once the ‘Load my own data’ button is clicked,  a dialogue box will appear prompting you to enter your data in a JSON format. Once entered, click the ‘Load data’ button at the bottom of the screen.</p>
<p>Please Note: Some fields will only accept numerical data. In the event that the data does not match the parameters for a specific field, an error statement will appear describing the type of data to be entered to correct the error.</p>
<p>After filling in the data, either manually or by an upload, click the submit button at the very bottom. The tool will produce the entered data in a JSON format in a box at the very end. Copy this output into a text file and save it in a JSON format. **Please note that clicking submit does not mean that the output is actually submitted to OMB.** The output must be posted on agencies' ‘agency’.gov/digitalstrategy/ webpages. OMB will access these files using the links listed in the Agency Strategic Plan Locations page of this site.
</p>
<p>NOTE that the DCOI also requires that agencies post data center-related milestones to their FITARAmilestones.json files describing steps the agency will take to achieve the goals of the DCOI. Guidance surrounding the DCOI milestones is located at <a href="https://management.cio.gov/schema" target="_blank">management.cio.gov/schema</a>. This tool does not address the DCOI milestones requirement of the DCOI.</p>
